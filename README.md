# Machine Learning
Repository dedicated to machine learning.

## Basics
###### I wanted to test my understanding of some basic machine learning concepts so I implemented the following with no Machine Learning Libraries.
* A linear regression model.

* A logistic regression model.

## MNIST
###### MNIST was a good starting place to learn the basics of PyTorch and of Neural Networks in general. I learnt about dense layers in a mutilayer perceptron network and about convolutional neural networks. I managed to classify the MNIST database using:
* A multi-layer perceptron neural network which achieved a max accuracy of 99.1%

* A Convolutional Neural Network - maximum accuracy of 99.45%

## Cats vs. Dogs Dataset.
###### To further my understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks I wanted to classify a labeled dataset of cats and dogs. This task required me to manually clean the data as the images were not a uniform size. I classified this dataset using:
* A Convolutional Neural Network, needs more work/tuning.

## CIFAR-10.
###### CIFAR-10 is a step up from the Cats vs. Dogs dataset as there are 10 classes as opposed to 2 classes, this being said, I was able to classify the CIFAR dataset using:
* A CNN at almost at 90% accuracy.

# Reinforcement Learning
After practicing the basics of Neural Networks through the previous datasets, I wanted to be able to apply machine learning to something more visual like a game, this lead me to Q learning.

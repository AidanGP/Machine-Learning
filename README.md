# Machine-Learning
Repository dedicated to machine learning.

## Basics
###### I wanted to test my understanding of some basic machine learning concepts so I implemented the following with no Machine Learning Libraries.
* Finished implementing a linear regression model with no PyTorch.

* Finished implementing a logistic regression model with no PyTorch.

MNIST
* Finished using a multi-layer perceptron neural network achieving a maximum accuracy of approx. 98.4
* Finished using a Convolutional Neural Network - maximum accuracy of 99.2

Cats vs. Dogs Dataset.
* Done using a Convolutional Neural Network, needs more work/tuning.

CIFAR-10.
* Done using a CNN, almost at 90% accuracy.

# Want to do:
EMNIST -
